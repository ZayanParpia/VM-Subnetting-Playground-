Act as a cloud security engineer with 15 years of exp and assume I am a student getting into cybersec. I want you to guide me step by step through a VM-based subnetting lab where I set up two virtual machines in different subnets, assign IP addresses, test connectivity with ping, and explore routing and ARP tables. Explain each step clearly, tell me which commands to run, what outputs to expect, why certain pings succeed or fail, and give me questions to think about so I fully understand how subnet masks and routing work in practice

This is the project outline

Cloud VM Subnetting Playground — Outline

Project Description:
This project is a hands-on lab where you create two virtual machines in the cloud, place them in different subnets, and explore how they communicate (or don’t) based on subnet masks and routing rules. It’s designed to teach how networks are segmented and how devices interact in real cloud environments, giving you practical experience with networking concepts used in cybersecurity and cloud engineering.

Purpose / What You Learn:

Understand subnet masks, network addresses, and broadcast addresses.

Observe why devices in different subnets cannot communicate directly without routing.

Explore ARP tables and routing tables in real operating systems.

Gain familiarity with cloud networking concepts like VPCs, private IPs, and subnet isolation.

Build foundational skills for cloud security, network segmentation, and secure infrastructure design.

Tools / Requirements:

A cloud platform account (AWS, Azure, or GCP).

2 small virtual machines (Linux or Windows).

Terminal / SSH for Linux or CMD / PowerShell / RDP for Windows.

Basic understanding of IP addresses and subnetting.

Time & Difficulty:

Estimated time: 2–3 hours.

Difficulty: Easy–Medium — beginner-friendly but gives a realistic cloud networking experience.

Why It’s Useful for Cybersecurity Students:

Teaches practical network segmentation, which is critical for securing systems in the cloud.

Provides experience troubleshooting connectivity and routing — key skills for cloud security engineers.

Gives insight into how enterprise networks isolate and protect different systems using subnets.
